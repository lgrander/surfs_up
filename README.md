The analysis focused on the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures for the suspected hottest and coldest month of the year.The purpose of the analysis is to help an investor determine 

## Results
Utilizing over 1500 temperature measurement for each month between 2010 and 2017 we can determine the stability of temperature in Oahu. Based on our analysis the months of June and December have a very similar average temperate. There is less than a 4 degree difference in the average temperature of the two months. The average along with a low standard deviation implies that the weather in Oahu does not seem to fluctuate enough to cause instability in business.

## Summmary
By comparing the temperate statics of the two months we can conclude that the temperature patterns at Oahu remain steady through the whole year. However, there are two additional queries that would help us determine the stability of the shop. The first is an analysis of the rainfall for the entire year. The second is the daily average wave height for the entire year. Each of those factors could cause business to be unstable if the conditions are not favorable.
